    A few important points:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The EPA {{ PORTAL }} is a place for <i>creating and sharing maps and map applications</i>. Depending on your access level, you may only be able to view content items, or you may be able to collaborate by creating and editing items.
    </li>
    <li>
        Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is now required to be enabled on all accounts per <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-09/information_security_identification_and_authentication_procedure.pdf">security policy</a>. Guidance for the simple process of enabling two-factor authentication can be found in <a href="https://epa.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/079ede9b32464c73815d386703d3f88b/data">this document</a>. You will have a short grace period following account creation to enable MFA, after which your account will be automatically disabled.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you do something with the {{ PORTAL }} that <i>you would like to share</i> with our community, please contact us and let us know! The best contact is this email address: <a href="mailto:GeoServices@epa.gov">GeoServices@epa.gov</a>.

    <li>
        We hope that you enjoy using this platform to build and enhance your mapping capabilities, but we also have one major rule to consider as you use the {{ PORTAL }}:<br>
        <span style="color:red;"><strong>No PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII) or National Security Information (NSI) can be stored on the {{ PORTAL }}.</strong>&nbsp;</span><br>
        If you need a place for storing names, social security numbers, phone numbers, home addresses and the like â€“ PLEASE do not store them here. PII or NSI found in the {{ PORTAL }}, whether added inadvertently or intentionally, will be removed.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Thank you for your attention to this important information and welcome again to the {{ PORTAL }} community.<br>
